I am a second-year PhD student in [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am co-advised by Profs. [Andreas Haeberlen](https://haeberlen.cis.upenn.edu/) and [Linh Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/). My research interests include distributed systems, security, privacy, and applied cryptography.

I graduated with an M.Eng. and a B.A. (both in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/)) from Cornell University, where I did research under the supervision of Profs. [Robbert van Renesse](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/), [Hakim Weatherspoon](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hweather/), and [Andrew Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/).

I am from Guwahati, India.
